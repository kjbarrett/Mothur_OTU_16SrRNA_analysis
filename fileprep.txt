# In Terminal move all fastq.g files into one directory 
find file_location -name '*fastq.gz' -exec cp {} input_directory \;

# Then run the following command to unzip them all
gzip -d $(find ./ -type f -name '*.gz')

# Rename all files to remove characters not allowed (: - /) but be warned, this may result in names disappearing
# To circumvent, can leave dash and then change (find + replace) in resulting .files
